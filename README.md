# Welcome to Rainbow Table!

This project offers a simple yet powerful way to explore the SHA hash function visually. By providing color-coded representations of input values and their resulting hash outputs, Rainbow Table aims to enhance understanding of cryptographic algorithms, particularly in the context of password security.

Features:

- Intuitive interface for easy exploration of hash functions.
- Color-coded visualization of input values and hash outputs.
- Zoom feature to expand view.
